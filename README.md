  abstract = {Deamidation frequently is invoked as an important driver of crystallin aggregation and cataract formation. Here, we characterized the structural and biophysical consequences of cumulative Asn to Asp changes in γD-crystallin. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that N- or C-terminal domain-confined or fully Asn to Asp changed γD-crystallin exhibits essentially the same 1H-15N HSQC spectrum as the wild-type protein, implying that the overall structure is retained. Only a very small thermodynamic destabilization for the overall Asn to Asp γD-crystallin variants was noted by chaotropic unfolding, and assessment of the colloidal stability, by measuring diffusion interaction parameters, yielded no substantive differences in association propensities. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulations, no significant changes in dynamics for proteins with Asn to Asp or iso-Asp changes were detected. Our combined results demonstrate that substitution of all Asn by Asp residues, reflecting an extreme case of deamidation, did not affect the structure and biophysical properties of γD-crystallin. This suggests that these changes alone cannot be the major determinant in driving cataract formation.},
